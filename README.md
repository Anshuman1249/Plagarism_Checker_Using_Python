# Plagiarism Checker

## Description

The Plagiarism Checker is a Python-based tool designed to detect plagiarism in text documents. It utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to compare the similarity between different documents and identify potential instances of plagiarism.

## Key Features

1. Document Comparison: The tool compares the content of multiple documents to determine the level of similarity between them.

2. Plagiarism Detection: It identifies potential instances of plagiarism by analyzing the text similarities and patterns.

3. Customizable Thresholds: Users can set thresholds to define the level of similarity at which plagiarism is flagged.

4. Multiple File Formats: The tool supports various file formats, including plain text files (.txt), Microsoft Word documents (.docx), and more.

## How It Works
  1.Document Processing: The tool takes input documents and preprocesses them, removing irrelevant information like stop words and punctuation.

  2.Text Comparison: It applies NLP techniques, such as stemming, and vectorization,it also uses Levenshtein's Algorithm to convert the documents into numerical representations.

  3.Similarity Measurement: The tool calculates the similarity scores between the documents using algorithms like cosine similarity or Jaccard index.

  4.Threshold Evaluation: The calculated similarity scores are compared against the user-defined thresholds to determine if plagiarism is present.
