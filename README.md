# Plagiarism Checker

# Description
The Plagiarism Checker is a Python-based tool designed to detect plagiarism in text documents. It utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to compare the similarity between different documents and identify potential instances of plagiarism.

# Key Features
Document Comparison: The tool compares the content of multiple documents to determine the level of similarity between them.
Plagiarism Detection: It identifies potential instances of plagiarism by analyzing the text similarities and patterns.
Customizable Thresholds: Users can set thresholds to define the level of similarity at which plagiarism is flagged.
Multiple File Formats: The tool supports various file formats, including plain text files (.txt), Microsoft Word documents (.docx), and more.

# How It Works
Document Processing: The tool takes input documents and preprocesses them, removing irrelevant information like stop words and punctuation.

Text Comparison: It applies NLP techniques, such as tokenization, stemming, and vectorization, to convert the documents into numerical representations.

Similarity Measurement: The tool calculates the similarity scores between the documents using algorithms like cosine similarity or Jaccard index.

Threshold Evaluation: The calculated similarity scores are compared against the user-defined thresholds to determine if plagiarism is present.
